# Second year of bioinformatics master's degree project :
# Visual analysis of gene expression data

From a regulation network of Escherichia coli genes dataset, we wrote a script used on the framework of data visualisation Tulip in order to display and analyse it. 


## Getting Started

To get files, open your terminal in the folder where you want to store and write : 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/HansSCHR/tulip_project/
```

### Prerequisites

To run the script you need a linux environment, to install Python and the framework Tulip. 

You can use Python2 or Python3. Python2 is installed by default in your linux environment. If you want install Python3, run in your terminal : 

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```
To install Tulip, you can download the last AppImage version : http://tulip.labri.fr/TulipDrupal/


### Running

1) Run Tulip.

2) Load file : In the "File" tab, select "Open" and choose the file "results.tlpx". 

The script is already launched. You can see it in the "Python IDE" window. 
To open it, tape on the button "Python IDE" on the left sidebar.
